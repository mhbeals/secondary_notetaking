# Secondary Notetaking
*A XML sample and XSLT style sheet for taking notes from secondary sources*

sample.xml is currently set to use notes.xsl as a default stylesheet, resulting in a colour-coded HTML document, but mdnotes.xsl can be used to transform the file into a MarkDown document instead

Please feel free to suggest additions and alterations via 'issues'
